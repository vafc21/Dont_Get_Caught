# Dont_Get_Caught
 This is the first game I've ever made using Pygame! It's a simple but challenging game where you must avoid getting caught by the enemies. Use your reflexes and strategy to stay alive as long as possible.  I created this project to learn the basics of game development with Python and Pygame. More features and improvements may come as I keep learning!
