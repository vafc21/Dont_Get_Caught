# My First Pygame Game

## Description  
This is the first game I've ever made using **Pygame**! It's a simple but challenging game where you must **avoid getting caught by the enemies**. Use your reflexes and timing to survive as long as you can.

I created this project to learn the basics of game development with Python and Pygame. I’ll continue to improve it as I learn more!
